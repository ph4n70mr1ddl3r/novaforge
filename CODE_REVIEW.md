# NovaForge Code Review Report

**Date:** 2025-08-26  
**Reviewer:** AI Code Review Assistant  
**Scope:** Full platform (platform libs, services, deploy modules)

---

## Executive Summary

The NovaForge codebase is a well-architected, metadata-driven no-code platform built on Spring Boot 4.x, Java 21, and a multi-module Maven structure. The code demonstrates strong architectural discipline (enforced via ArchUnit), thoughtful security design (multi-tenant isolation, service-to-service auth), and comprehensive test coverage using Testcontainers.

However, several **critical and high-priority issues** were identified that affect correctness, security, and maintainability.

---

## Critical Issues

### 1. ScriptSandbox - Resource Leak in Watchdog (CRITICAL)
**File:** `services/script-engine/src/main/java/com/novaforge/script/engine/ScriptSandbox.java`  
**Lines:** 160-200

The `watchdog.scheduleAtFixedRate()` creates a recurring task that holds references to the `Context`, `logs`, and `killReason`. If an exception occurs before `watch.cancel(false)` in the `finally` block, the task continues executing and prevents garbage collection of the GraalVM Context.

**Risk:** Memory leak under error conditions; Context not properly closed.

**Fix:** Wrap the watchdog task in a try-finally that ensures cancellation, or use a try-with-resources pattern for the scheduled future.

---

### 2. ScriptSandbox - Thread ID Reuse Race (CRITICAL)
**File:** `services/script-engine/src/main/java/com/novaforge/script/engine/ScriptSandbox.java`  
**Line:** 170

```java
Thread executor = Thread.currentThread();
long executorId = executor.getId();
```

Thread IDs are reused by the JVM thread pool. If a script execution completes and the thread is reused for another request, the watchdog will measure CPU time from the *new* execution, incorrectly attributing it to the previous one.

**Fix:** Use `ThreadMXBean.getThreadCpuTime(Thread.currentThread().getId())` inside the watchdog task itself, or use a dedicated executor thread pool with isolated threads.

---

### 3. ServiceTokenClient - Token Refresh Race Condition (CRITICAL)
**File:** `platform/libs/security-context/src/main/java/com/novaforge/security/ServiceTokenClient.java`  
**Lines:** 60-95

Multiple threads can simultaneously detect an expired `grant` and all execute the HTTP token request. While "benign" per comments, this:
- Wastes network/CPU resources
- Can trigger rate limiting on Keycloak
- Increases latency for all callers during refresh

**Fix:** Use double-checked locking with a `CompletableFuture` or `StampedLock` to ensure only one refresh occurs.

---

### 4. ConnectorExecutor - OAuth2 Token Cache Race (CRITICAL)
**File:** `services/integration-service/src/main/java/com/novaforge/integration/connector/ConnectorExecutor.java`  
**Lines:** 240-265

The `tokenCache` check-then-act pattern is not atomic:
```java
CachedToken cached = tokenCache.get(credential.id());
if (cached != null && Instant.now().isBefore(cached.refreshAt())) {
    return cached.token();
}
// ... fetch new token ...
tokenCache.put(credential.id(), new CachedToken(...));
```

Multiple threads can fetch tokens simultaneously.

**Fix:** Use `ConcurrentHashMap.computeIfAbsent` with a refresh-aware supplier, or `CompletableFuture` memoization.

---

### 5. TenantContext - ThreadLocal Leakage in Virtual Threads (CRITICAL)
**File:** `platform/libs/common-core/src/main/java/com/novaforge/common/context/TenantContext.java`

Java 21 virtual threads have different ThreadLocal semantics. The `ThreadLocal<Context>` holder:
- May not be inherited by virtual threads spawned from platform threads
- Can leak if virtual threads are pooled without proper cleanup
- `TenantTaskDecorator` only applies to `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor`, not all executors

**Fix:** Use `InheritableThreadLocal` for virtual thread compatibility, and enforce decorator on all executor beans via auto-configuration.

---

## High Priority Issues

### 6. ScriptSandbox - Heap Measurement False Positives (HIGH)
**File:** `services/script-engine/src/main/java/com/novaforge/script/engine/ScriptSandbox.java`  
**Lines:** 195-205

The two-sample heap check has a race: GC can run between samples, causing a transient spike to be missed or a real leak to be masked by GC.

**Fix:** Use a longer observation window (e.g., 3 samples over 100ms) or integrate with GC notifications via `MemoryPoolMXBean`.

---

### 7. ConnectorExecutor - RestClient Created Per Call (HIGH)
**File:** `services/integration-service/src/main/java/com/novaforge/integration/connector/ConnectorExecutor.java`  
**Line:** 180

```java
RestClient client = RestClient.builder()
    .requestFactory(timedFactory())
    .build();
```

Creates a new `RestClient` (and connection pool) for every connector call. This defeats connection pooling and HTTP/2 multiplexing.

**Fix:** Create a shared `RestClient` bean per connector (or use `RestClient.Builder` prototype scope).

---

### 8. ConnectorExecutor - Client Secret in Request Body (HIGH)
**File:** `services/integration-service/src/main/java/com/novaforge/integration/connector/ConnectorExecutor.java`  
**Line:** 260

OAuth2 client credentials grant sends `client_secret` in the form body, which may be logged by proxies, load balancers, or the auth server's access logs.

**Fix:** Use HTTP Basic Auth for client credentials (RFC 6749 §2.3.1) or ensure secrets are masked in logs.

---

### 9. Inconsistent Error Handling / Stack Trace Loss (HIGH)
**Files:** Multiple services

Patterns like:
```java
} catch (Exception e) {
    throw new PlatformException(PlatformErrorCode.INTERNAL, "failed: " + e.getMessage());
}
```
Lose the original stack trace. The `PlatformException(..., cause)` constructor exists but is inconsistently used.

**Fix:** Always pass the cause: `new PlatformException(code, msg, detail, cause)`.

---

### 10. Manual JSON String Construction (HIGH)
**Files:** Multiple (e.g., `RecordController.encodeQuery`, `RecordApiTests`)

JSON is manually constructed via `StringBuilder` and `URLEncoder`, which is brittle and doesn't handle escaping correctly in all cases.

**Fix:** Use `ObjectMapper`/`JsonMapper` for all JSON serialization.

---

## Medium Priority Issues

### 11. Duplicate Infrastructure Code Across Services (MEDIUM)
**Files:** Every service has nearly identical:
- `ProblemAdvice.java`
- `SecurityConfig.java`  
- `TenantBindingFilter.java`
- `ProblemAuthenticationEntryPoint.java`
- `OpenApiConfig.java`

**Fix:** Extract to `novaforge-common-web` module.

---

### 12. Magic Numbers / Hardcoded Limits (MEDIUM)
**Examples:**
- `ScriptSandbox.MAX_ENTRIES = 100` (hardcoded log limit)
- `ScriptSandbox.Converter.MAX_NODES = 8192` (arbitrary)
- `RecordEngine.MAX_INLINE_CHILDREN = 100`
- `RecordEngine.MAX_BATCH = 500`
- Various timeouts in `application.yml` not centralized

**Fix:** Centralize in configuration properties with `@ConfigurationProperties` validation.

---

### 13. Circuit Breaker Proliferation (MEDIUM)
**File:** `services/integration-service/src/main/java/com/novaforge/integration/connector/ConnectorExecutor.java`  
**Line:** 108

```java
CircuitBreaker breaker = breakers.circuitBreaker(tenantId + ":" + connectorId);
```

Creates a circuit breaker per tenant+connector combination. With many tenants, this creates thousands of circuit breaker instances.

**Fix:** Use a shared circuit breaker per connector (tenant isolation is at the credential level, not circuit level).

---

### 14. Missing Input Validation (MEDIUM)
**Files:** Multiple controllers

UUID parsing without validation:
```java
UUID.fromString(request.tenantId())  // throws IAE if invalid
```

**Fix:** Add `@Valid` + custom validators, or validate early with clear error messages.

---

## Low Priority Issues

### 15. Extensive PHASE/ADR References in Comments (LOW)
Comments reference internal documents (PHASE-0, ADR-003, etc.) that external contributors won't have access to. While useful for the core team, they reduce readability.

**Fix:** Keep architectural context but add inline explanatory comments for key decisions.

---

### 16. Long Methods (LOW)
`RecordEngine.create()`, `update()`, `delete()` exceed 100 lines each with multiple responsibilities.

**Fix:** Extract to private methods with clear names (already partially done, but could go further).

---

### 17. Inconsistent `var` Usage (LOW)
Some files use `var` extensively, others use explicit types. No project-wide convention.

**Fix:** Define a style rule (e.g., "use `var` when type is obvious from RHS").

---

## Recommendations Summary

| Priority | Count | Est. Effort |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Critical | 5 | 2-3 days |
| High | 5 | 2-3 days |
| Medium | 4 | 1-2 days |
| Low | 3 | < 1 day |

**Total Estimated Effort:** 5-8 days for full remediation
