# Implementation Status

Tracks what is built versus the phase specs. Each entry names the spec sections the
code implements and the suites that verify it. The corpus is the contract; this file is
the ledger.

## Phase 0 — Foundations ✅ (spec: PHASE-0-FOUNDATIONS.md)

- Monorepo: root parent POM (Boot 4.1.0 / Framework 7.0.8 / Cloud 2025.1.2 per
  ADR-007), `platform/libs` + `services` aggregators, Maven wrapper.
- `novaforge-common-core`: TenantContext, error model (`4000/4001/4003/4004/4090/5000`
  seed registry), ProblemErrors, PlatformException.
- Gateway (8080): YAML routes, JWT validation (problem+json 401s), `X-Tenant-Id`
  derivation from the `tenant_id` claim.
- Metadata-service skeleton (8081): ping pins the exact framework version (drift rule).
- Compose stack (`deploy/compose`): Keycloak 26.7.2 (realm `novaforge`, client
  `novaforge-api`, `novaforge.api` scope with tenant/actor/platform-roles claim
  mappers, confidential service client `novaforge-runtime`, demo user), Postgres 16.15,
  Redis 7.4.11, Kafka 4.3.1, Prometheus + Grafana with the seeded Phase 0 dashboard.
- CI: GitHub Actions build (ubuntu) + the Podman-socket self-hosted job (§9's Phase 1
  wiring).

## Phase 1 — Metadata Core & Data Runtime ✅ (spec: PHASE-1-METADATA-CORE.md)

- **ADR-001 closed**: 1M-row spike, variant B chosen (generated projections,
  trigger-maintained); measured numbers + revisit triggers in the ADR. The
  cast-immutability constraint (no `::date` in index expressions) lowered to policy:
  promote text/numeric only, canonical ISO text for temporal ordering.
- Shared libs: `metadata-model` (definition POJOs + JSON Schema v0 + the §3 rule
  matrix), `security-context` (task decorator, RLS DataSource bridge, event headers),
  `test-support` (Postgres/Redis container bases, RLS fixtures, shared ArchUnit rules).
- Metadata Service (8081): draft CRUD, save validation, publish with compatibility
  check + `acknowledgeDataImpact`, immutable versions + export, published read,
  `published-apps` index, `metadata.published` on Redis pub/sub.
- Data Runtime (8083, module split `api/engine/storage/authorization`): the full §5/§6/§7
  surface — write path (defaults incl. sequence refs drawn once at create, field
  validations, inline children ≤100 with cascade delete, optimistic locking, soft
  delete, uniqueness via partial unique indexes), query path (DSL GET + `/query`
  aggregates, batch ≤500 with per-item outcomes), sequences (cached Redis blocks +
  gapless in-transaction), Idempotency-Key on create/batch, RLS everywhere (fail-closed
  policies; the system role carries BYPASSRLS for the materializer/catch-up —
  documented in `deploy/postgres-init`), platform authorization store + role matrix
  (fail closed), materializer reacting to publish + restart catch-up, ArchUnit layering.
- **Exit demo verified live** (compose stack + services + real Keycloak tokens):
  app → publish → CRUD with gapless `JE-00000x` numbering, inline lines, 409 on stale
  versions, idempotent replay, aggregates. Load test (§10): read p95 39.4 ms
  (< 50), list p95 37.2 ms (< 300), write p95 33.4 ms (≤ 100) — PASS
  (`docs/loadtests/results-2026-08-21.md`).
- Environment track: Kind-on-Podman config, per-service Helm charts + umbrella,
  Skaffold (jib) — written; live cluster bring-up is the remaining operational check
  (validated declaratively; not yet exercised against a running Kind cluster).

Suites: 176 tests, `./mvnw verify` green (Testcontainers: Postgres + Redis + Kafka;
rootless Podman socket env documented in the README).

**Live verification:** the full spine runs on the compose stack — Keycloak → gateway →
metadata → runtime with the outbox → Kafka → audit trail all observed live (create with
inline children → 4 outbox rows published → `novaforge.record` carries the events →
`GET /api/v1/audit/records/{id}` serves the trail through the gateway).

## Phase 2 — Builder UI & Security ◐ (spec: PHASE-2-UI-BUILDER.md)

**Backend implemented:**
- `expression-dsl` (expr/v1, §7/Annex A): the JVM parser/evaluator with the pinned
  grammar — exact BigDecimal semantics, null-aware operators, date arithmetic,
  membership, the closed function set, injectable clock — plus the shared conformance
  corpus (40 cases) and compile-check wired into the Metadata Service save/publish
  (validations may read the clock; formula fields may not, PHASE-3 §3). Slots stay
  inert until Phase 3 write-path evaluation.
- RBAC + field security (§9): PermissionSet as versioned, promoted metadata
  (roles, object CRUD matrix, field visible/readonly/hidden) with save-validation
  rules; server-side enforcement in the Data Runtime — the matrix decides
  create/read/update/delete per app-scoped role (`App.role` assignments in the
  platform DB), hidden fields strip from every projection, writes to
  hidden/readonly fields reject.
- Tenant onboarding + platform-admin API (§10): `POST /api/v1/admin/tenants`
  (tenant row + first admin, orchestrating Keycloak user creation via the service
  account with realm-management roles) and role assignments — admin-gated, riding
  the engine behind a UserProvisioner port (layering rules hold).
- Realm export: service account `service-account-novaforge-runtime` with
  manage-users; role-assignment check widened for app-scoped roles (V2 migration).

**Not implemented:** the React builder/runtime UIs (§3–§6, §8 — the largest remaining
Phase 2 surface: page model, component catalog, renderer, entity/page builders) and
the TS evaluator twin for the conformance corpus. Backend surfaces are ready for it:
published reads, expression bindings compile-checked, field security stripping.

## Phase 3 — Business Logic ◐ (spec: PHASE-3-BUSINESS-LOGIC.md)

**Implemented — §3 write-path evaluation** (the ARCHITECTURE §2.4 chain is now:
resolve → authorize → defaults → formula/roll-up evaluation → validation rules →
persist → event seam → shaped projection):
- expression defaults (`{"expression": "…"}` — clock-free, compile-checked, evaluated
  at the defaults step before validations)
- validation rules (record-scope expressions extending Phase 1 field constraints,
  failing with the authored message)
- formula fields (own-record expressions stored at write time, never computed on
  read; implicitly readonly; null-propagating string/numeric functions keep stored
  formulas total)
- roll-up summaries (`SUM/COUNT/MIN/MAX/AVG(relationship[.field])` — creates
  aggregate the in-memory child set; updates recompute in the child's write
  transaction and only rewrite the parent when a value moved)

**Implemented — §4 event spine + §5 audit:**
- transactional outbox (`event_outbox`): record events ride the creating transaction;
  the KafkaOutboxRelay publishes committed rows at-least-once to family topics
  (`novaforge.record`), keyed `tenantId:recordId` for per-record ordering, event id +
  type + tenant in headers, then marks rows published (stop-on-failure preserves order)
- Audit Service v1 (`novaforge-audit-service`, port 8085): consumes `novaforge.record`
  into an append-only, monthly-partitioned Postgres trail (`audit_events`, PK
  `(event_id, occurred_at)` — identical redeliveries collapse); tenant-scoped reads
  through the gateway (`/api/v1/audit/records/{id}`, `/api/v1/audit/entities/{id}`);
  Prometheus scrape + Helm chart + umbrella entry; the durable trail PHASE-2 §9
  promised

**Implemented — §2 flow-IR hooks (ADR-008 #1–2):**
- metadata: HookRule (`{trigger, flow}`) + FlowStep graphs on entities (schema v0
  extended); the publish-time FlowCompiler reference/type-checks every step —
  ops from the closed v1 set, DAG enforcement (cycles and dangling chains
  reject), setField fields exist, guard/setField expressions compile, record
  templates address existing fields on their target entity, iterate paths are
  relationships; grammar-fixed ops (requestApproval/transitionState/callConnector)
  compile and fail loudly only if executed before Phases 4/6
- runtime: HookExecutor on the write path — setField (expression), createRecord/
  updateRecord (${…} templates, nested engine writes as the per-app system
  principal with a depth budget), publishEvent (rides the outbox spine),
  branch (guard), iterate (relationship body over live children); failure policy
  per ARCHITECTURE §2.5 (before-hooks abort the transaction, after-hook failures
  are recorded, never lost, never block the write)
- **exit scenario green**: order → beforeSave stamps the label, afterSave iterates
  lines and reserves inventory stock via updateRecord — totals via roll-ups,
  reservation via a hook, zero app code

**Implemented — §7 builder test harness (ADR-010):**
- `TestSuiteDefinition` (Tests branch): fixtures → steps → assertions, the pinned
  encoding — step vocabulary createRecord/updateRecord/deleteRecord with `${…}`
  templates (monetary values as strings), `expect: ok | error(code) | validation(rule)`,
  assertions as DSL predicates over `${Entity[n].path}` references resolved to exact
  decimal literals
- suite APIs on the Metadata Service: PUT `/apps/{id}/test-suites/{name}` (ops and
  expectations validated on save) and POST `.../run`
- the runner: fresh scratch tenant per run via the platform-admin API (tenant
  offboarding is unmodeled in v1 — PHASE-2 §10), synthetic actors provisioned with
  role impersonation through Keycloak (firstName/lastName + email set — Keycloak 26's
  Verify Profile blocks first login otherwise; tenant_id + platform_roles ride
  declared managed attributes the provisioner ensures on boot), the candidate bundle
  published into the scratch tenant (never a mutable draft), steps replayed through
  the generic runtime APIs as the actors (4xx bodies are results, matched against
  expectations), assertions evaluated under the run's frozen clock
**Implemented — §6 Script Engine v0 (ADR-003, T6):**
- `novaforge-script-engine` (port 8084, internal — hooks invoke it, no gateway route):
  GraalVM JS on the community jars, one `Context` per execution (no warm pools —
  deferred with demand), no host I/O or classes, and the ADR's caps made real —
  statement watchdog (`ResourceLimits`), CPU-time cap (ThreadMXBean-sampled force
  close), heap tripwire (process-growth attribution; per-context metering is
  Enterprise-only), wall-clock backstop, bounded concurrency with a bounded queue —
  the watchdog stays armed through result conversion (getters/proxies run guest code)
- the closed surface: `$record` (read-only view, `id` included), `$data.query` (the
  Data Runtime list API under the calling user's relayed token — no service-account
  fallback, a script can never exceed its authorizing user's grants), `$log` (bounded
  capture); the program's completion value is the result (integral numbers stay
  integral; conversion bounded)
- metadata: `ScriptDefinition` artifact riding the app definition (versioned on the
  same review/promotion path); `HookRule` is flow XOR script, publish-enforced
  (language set, source size, blank rejects)
- runtime: HookExecutor script branch — caller-context through RestScriptEngineClient
  (the write request's token relayed verbatim), beforeSave return-merge into declared
  fields (reserved names pass through), failure policy uniform with flows; script
  hooks die at the same caps through the engine and render problem+json on the write
  path
- script-ratio telemetry per app version: engine-side
  `novaforge.script.executions{app,version,trigger,outcome}` + duration; runtime-side
  `novaforge.hook.executions{app,version,trigger,kind}` — the ratio joins on the
  dashboards (§9)
- deploy: helm chart + umbrella dependency + prometheus scrape; graalvm pins in the
  parent dependencyManagement (the `js-community` coordinates are pom-packaging
  aggregators — the concrete community jars are polyglot/js-language/regex)
- **T6 acceptance pinned**: a capped script (infinite loop, getter bomb, heap hog)
  dies at its budget and the service stays on its feet; host access closed;
  authorization verdicts (FORBIDDEN et al.) survive the sandbox boundary

**Implemented — §2 failure policy, the retry leg (phase close):**
- after-hook failures ride the spine out of the write's own transaction: the engine
  emits `hook.retry` outbox rows (trigger, hook, kind, attempt, error in the payload
  envelope) — never lost, never blocking the write; the relay publishes them to
  `novaforge.hook` (family topic)
- the retry consumer on the spine (`HookRetryConsumer`, group `novaforge-hook-retry`)
  claims events idempotently — the spine's event id is the `hook_retry_log` PK, so
  at-least-once redelivery collapses
- the scanner re-drives due rows through the real write path
  (`RecordEngine.retryAfterHook`): the record's **current** state, the per-app system
  principal — the identical context to the original execution (§13 Q1) — under
  exponential backoff (base 5 s, ×2 per attempt, capped 10 min, 8 attempts default),
  then parks durably (never silently dropped; `novaforge.hook.retry.outcome{result}`
  + a pending gauge)
- script-kind failures park at consume time by design: scripts are caller-context
  only (ADR-003 #2) and the spine has no user token to relay — parking keeps the
  failure visible instead of silently escalating to a service account
- non-convergent retries park immediately: hook gone from the republished definition,
  record since deleted

**Implemented — §9 observability expansion (phase close):**
- Tempo 2.10 (OTLP gRPC 4317 + HTTP 4318) and Loki 3.6 + promtail join the compose
  stack; every service exports spans OTLP-direct to Tempo (no collector — §13 Q4).
  Boot 4's modular tracing wiring: `spring-boot-micrometer-tracing-opentelemetry`
  (the autoconfiguration) + `micrometer-tracing-bridge-otel` + the pinned
  `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-otlp` (the OTLP autoconfig's
  `@ConditionalOnClass` — Boot's BOM doesn't manage it), configured under
  `management.opentelemetry.tracing.*` with the sampler switchable
  (`NOVAFORGE_TRACE_SAMPLER`, default always-on for local)
- logs ship to Loki: services file-log to a shared dir
  (`NOVAFORGE_LOG_DIR`, default `/tmp/novaforge/logs`) that promtail tails with a
  per-service label; the Loki datasource derives trace-id deep links into Tempo from
  the shared `LEVEL [service,traceId,spanId]` pattern
- kafka-exporter joins (via a new in-network Kafka `INTERNAL` listener — advertised
  listeners must match where each client lives) and Prometheus scrapes it
- new dashboards: the "NovaForge / Phase 3" board — Kafka consumer lag, hook-duration
  histograms (`novaforge.hook.duration{trigger,kind}` — new Timer in the executor),
  script ratio per app version, suite pass rates (`novaforge.suite.runs{app,outcome}`
  — new counter in the harness runner), after-hook retry outcomes + backlog

**Phase 3 closed:** all §1–§9 surfaces implemented. The environment track's live
Kind-cluster bring-up remains the one outstanding operational check (declaratively
validated; carried from Phase 1).

## Phase 4 — Workflow & Approvals ◐ (spec: PHASE-4-WORKFLOW-APPROVALS.md)

**Implemented — T2+T3 state machines (§3):**
- `StateMachineDefinition` (`{id, entity, stateField, initial, states, transitions}`
  with terminal flags and optional transition guards) rides the app definition as a
  first-class branch — one machine per entity in v1
- save validation: bound entity resolves, `stateField` is an enum field whose values
  contain every state, `initial` ∈ states, transitions reference known states,
  terminal states admit no outgoing edges, UPPER_SNAKE state names
- publish compilation: transition guards compile through the FlowCompiler's
  expression check (the same JVM engine and record-context policy as every other
  slot); `transitionState` steps compile-check their bound machine + target state
- write-path enforcement (the §3 pin — metadata enforced by the Data Runtime, like
  validations): create pins the initial state (a differing explicit value — or a
  hook-driven one — rejects with `STATE_TRANSITION` 4010); an update changing the
  state field requires a listed transition with a passing guard; terminal states
  freeze the state field only (whole-record freezing is Phase 7's
  `freezeOnTerminal`); nested engine writes (`updateRecord` from hooks) pass the
  same check
- `transitionState` primitive activated: a guarded field write into the record
  before persist — the write path's enforcement validates it, so flows, scripts,
  and humans share one check with no bypass
- error codes 4010 `STATE_TRANSITION` and 4011 `SOD_VIOLATION` joined the registry
  (§2; the seed set is a floor, not a ceiling)
- suites: `StateMachineTests` (§14 item 2 — create-pins-initial, hook-driven
  transitions ride the check, guard failures reject, terminal semantics, nested
  writes) + seven validator rules in `DefinitionValidatorTest`

**Implemented — T1 skeleton + T4 tasks & inbox (§5):**
- `novaforge-workflow-service` (port 8086, gateway route `/api/v1/workflow/**`, its own
  `novaforge_workflow` database, Prometheus scrape): the human-task plane of §5 —
  a pure spine participant that never mutates records
- task model per §5: `{type: approval|todo, entity, recordId, assignee|role, status,
  dueAt/warnAt, createdBy, contextRef}`; statuses OPEN → APPROVED | REJECTED |
  DELEGATED | ESCALATED | CANCELLED
- inbox API: `GET /tasks` (mine = assigned to me or one of my roles, open by default,
  server-side paged), `GET /tasks/{id}`, approve/reject with comment (re-resolution
  409s), claim (role task → assignee, stays OPEN), delegate (replacement task, the
  original DELEGATED, chain rooted via `contextRef`, delegation to the initiating
  actor rejected `SOD_VIOLATION`), reassign (admin/builder-only, audited)
- access enforced server-side (§13): assignee, the task's role holders, or platform
  admin; role resolution rides a new read endpoint on the runtime's admin surface
  (`GET /api/v1/admin/tenants/{t}/users/{u}/roles`) through the trusted service
  client — no cross-service database reads
- `task.*` events (`created/assigned/approved/rejected/delegated/escalated/cancelled`)
  ride a transactional outbox relayed to `novaforge.task` keyed `tenantId:taskId`
  (per-task ordering; delegation chains ride each delegate's own key)
- spine consumption (T1's leg): `record.deleted` on `novaforge.record` cancels the
  record's open tasks — verified through the real Kafka path
- suites: `TaskApiTests` — inbox resolution, resolution + events, claim, delegation
  chains + SoD, reassign gate, access checks, deletion-cancel
- Flowable itself is not yet a dependency: ADR-004's embedded engine enters with T5/T6
  (suspension + SLA timers) where it has work to do; the Boot 4 compatibility of the
  Flowable starter gets assessed at that boundary (deviation from T1's letter, noted)

**Implemented — T5 `requestApproval` + durable suspension + SoD (§4):**
- the primitive activates: a flow reaching `requestApproval` hands the approval to
  the Workflow Service's internal surface (`/api/v1/workflow/internal/approvals`,
  service-client gated) — step id, after-step pointer, and the optional inline
  `onReject` subgraph (the step's `body`) travel in the payload; execution of that
  flow ends there, so a suspension inside a write-path hook never holds the
  enclosing transaction — the triggering write commits
- durable instances (`wf_suspended_flows`): where the flow resumes, the onReject
  graph, and unanimity bookkeeping — `any` resumes on first resolution, `all` on
  unanimity; siblings after the first win are no-ops (exactly-once resume)
- resolution re-enters the compiled-graph engine through the runtime's internal
  `/api/v1/hooks/resume` (service-client gated, no gateway route): approve
  continues after the step; reject runs the step's own `onReject` subgraph, or the
  instance fails audibly (status FAILED + last_error, never silent); resume
  executes as the per-app system principal against the record's current state,
  with `transitionState` persisting through the standard guarded write on this
  path (no enclosing write carries the field)
- segregation of duties, fail closed (§4): the initiating actor is removed from
  explicit approver sets at suspension (empty remainder → `SOD_VIOLATION` renders
  onto the write path and aborts a beforeSave flow); role-targeted approvals
  enforce the same rule at resolution (the initiator cannot resolve their own
  request); delegation to the initiator rejects
- publish compilation: `requestApproval` params (approvers role/user-list, mode
  any|all) and the onReject subgraph are compile-checked like any graph fragment
- suites: `ApprovalFlowTests` (submit → suspends, write commits SUBMITTED; approve
  resumes to APPROVED; reject routes onReject to REJECTED; SoD aborts the write
  4011; the resume surface is service-client only) + three workflow-side cases
  (suspension→resume exactly once, SoD at resolution and at creation, onReject
  routing)

**Not implemented (Phase 4 remainder):** SLAs/escalation (T6), Scheduler (T7),
Notification v1 (T8), sharing rules (T9), builder/runtime UI (T10), harness growth
(T11).

## Phases 5–8 ⬜

Not started. `requestApproval`/`callConnector` grammar notes live in the specs.
